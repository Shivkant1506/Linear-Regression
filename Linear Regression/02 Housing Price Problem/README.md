# Housing Price Problem
I started learning from a book called: Hands-on Machine Learning With Scikit-learn, keras and tensorflow by Aurelien Geron

In the second chapter, they walk you through solving a real world ML problem.

This repository has the my code fused with theirs and my general understanding of the concepts as I go along with the book.
